<h3>Software Ages Like Milk, Not Wine</h3>
<p>Click on each version number above to see details on the vulnerabilities that were resolved in EAP 7 after the release dates of WildFly.  Red Hat does not track Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) in the community project WildFly.  Red Hat only tracks CVEs within our supported enterprise products.  These reports were generated using security metrics and tools available on the <a href="https://www.redhat.com/security/data/metrics/">Red Hat Security Data</a> page.  WildFly releases prior to version 10 likely have more vulnerabilities than those indicated because they significantly pre-dated the first release of EAP 7.</p>
