<h1>Summary of BRMS 6 Resolved Vulnerabilities</h1>
<h2>Red Hat JBoss BRMS is the enterprise product, Drools is the upstream community project</h2>
<p>Red Hat's JBoss Business Rules Management System (BRMS) is our enterprise business rules authoring, runtime, and management product that is derived from the upstream Drools community project.  There is a significant difference between an upstream open source community project and the downstream enterprise product.  Each release of BRMS is derived from a community release of Drools and then put through extensive quality engineering tests, defense in depth hardening, and a regular cadence of security patches and updates to meet the needs of enterprise users.  BRMS 6 was initially derived from Drools 6+, but has since undergone several security updates and patches.</p>
<h2>Resolved Vulnerabilities in BRMS</h2>
<p>The links below enumerate the vulnerabilities that were resolved in BRMS 6.4 after the release dates of Drools 6.5.0.Final.  Red Hat does not track Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) in the community project Drools.  Red Hat only tracks CVEs within our supported enterprise products.  These reports were generated using security metrics and tools available on the <a href="https://www.redhat.com/security/data/metrics/">Red Hat Security Data</a> page.</p>

</ul>
<h2>Release Notes containing bug fixes for BRMS</h2>
<p>Additionally, <a href="https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_jboss_brms/">Red Hat BRMS documentation</a> provides detailed release notes for the initial release of BRMS 6 and each successive cumulative patch update.</p>
<h2>How the reports were generated</h2>
The following files were downloaded from the <a href="https://www.redhat.com/security/data/metrics/">Red Hat Security Data</a> page:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.redhat.com/security/data/metrics/cve_dates.txt">cve_dates.txt</a> which is updated every one or two weeks (or by request, by contacting secalert@redhat.com).</li>
<li><a href="https://www.redhat.com/security/data/metrics/release_dates.txt">release_dates.txt</a> which is updated twice a day.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.redhat.com/security/data/metrics/rhsamapcpe.txt">rhsamapcpe.txt</a> which is updated twice a day.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.redhat.com/security/data/metrics/daysofrisk.pl">daysofrisk.pl</a> which is the perl script to generate the reports.</li>
</ul>
<p>Drools 6.5.0.Final was released on 2016-10-20, so all CVEs resolved against BRMS 6 after that date were reported using the command:</p>
<p><code>perl daysofrisk.pl --cpe jboss_enterprise_brms_platform:6 --dates 20161020- --xmlsummary BRMS6-resolved-issues-post-drools-6.5.0.Final-release-date.xml > BRMS6-resolved-issues-post-drools-6.5.0.Final-release-date.txt</code></p>
<p>The XML reports were formatted to HTML using the <a href="html-report.xsl">html-report.xsl</a> stylesheet.</p>
