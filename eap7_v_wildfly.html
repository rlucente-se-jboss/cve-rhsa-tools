<h1>Summary of EAP 7 Resolved Vulnerabilities</h1>
<h2>Red Hat Enterprise Application Platform is the enterprise product, WildFly is the community project</h2>
<p>Red Hat's Enterprise Application Platform (EAP) is our enterprise application server product that is derived from the upstream WildFly application server community project.  There is a significant difference between an upstream open source community project and the downstream enterprise product.  Each release of EAP is derived from a community release of WildFly and then put through extensive quality engineering tests, defense in depth hardening, and a regular cadence of security patches and updates to meet the needs of enterprise users.  EAP 7 was initially derived from WildFly 10+, but has since undergone several security updates and patches.</p>
<h2>Resolved Vulnerabilities in EAP</h2>
<p>The links below enumerate the vulnerabilities that were resolved in EAP 7 after the release dates of WildFly 10 and WildFly 11.  Red Hat does not track Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) in the community project WildFly.  Red Hat only tracks CVEs within our supported enterprise products.  These reports were generated using security metrics and tools available on the <a href="https://www.redhat.com/security/data/metrics/">Red Hat Security Data</a> page.</p>

<h2>Much Older Community WildFly Releases</h2>
<p>The links below enumerate the vulnerabilities that were resolved in EAP 7 after the release dates of much older versions of WildFly.  These releases likely have more vulnerabilities than those indicated because they significantly predated the first release of EAP 7 and Red Hat's tracking of vulnerabilities for that product.  Red Hat does not track Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) in the community project WildFly.  Red Hat only tracks CVEs within our supported enterprise products.  These reports were generated using security metrics and tools available on the <a href="https://www.redhat.com/security/data/metrics/">Red Hat Security Data</a> page.</p>
