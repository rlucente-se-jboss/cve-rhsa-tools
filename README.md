Use these tools to gather the number of vulnerabilities and Red Hat
Security Advisories (RHSA) for products.  To get the latest security
measurement files as well as the daysofrisk perl script, use the
command:

    ./refresh-security-measurement-files.sh

These two example commands will pull all of the vulnerabilities
before and after the EAP 6.2 CP04 release:

    perl daysofrisk.pl --cpe jboss_enterprise_application_platform:6 --dates -20140626 --xmlsummary summary-before-6.2.CP04.xml > count-before-6.2.CP04.txt
    perl daysofrisk.pl --cpe jboss_enterprise_application_platform:6 --dates 20140627- --xmlsummary summary-after-6.2.CP04.xml > count-after-6.2.CP04.txt

Usage documentation for the daysofrisk script is:

    usage: daysofrisk.pl [OPTIONS]
      --cpe <product/package to generate stats for>
                [examples: --cpe all
                           --cpe enterprise_linux
                           --cpe enterprise_linux:3
                           --cpe enterprise_linux:5::client/firefox
                           --cpe /httpd ]
      --severity <all|C|I|M|L|CI|CIM|IL...>
                [filter severity, 'C'ritical 'I'mportant 'M'oderate 'L'ow]
      --cvss <range>
                [filter on cvss base score, example '6.8'|'0-5'|'8-10'|'high'|...]
      --dates [<YYYYMMDD>]-[<YYYYMMDD>]
                [date range, default is 'all', example '20090101-'|'20080203-20080303']
      --xmlsummary <filename>
                [output the XML summary to this file, default summary.xml]

Multiple advisories (RHSA's) may map to a single vulnerability, so
the the most important count is the number of vulnerabilities.  The
vulnerabilities are categorized, in descending order, as (C)ritical,
(I)mportant, (M)oderate, and (L)ow.

In the following example, the number of vulnerabilities is the key
number since one vulnerability may map to multiple RHSA's.

    ** 66 advisories (C=8 I=24 L=9 M=25 )
    ** 52 vulnerabilities (C=1 I=11 L=16 M=24 )

There were fifty-two total vulnerabilities including one critical,
eleven important, twenty-four moderate, and sixteen low.

To format the report as HTML, simply prepend the following line in the XML summary file:

    <?xml-stylesheet type='text/xsl' href='html-report.xsl'?>

then open the file in a browser.  Alternatively, you can convert
the XML summary file to HTML using the command:

    mvn xml:transform

then open the resulting HTML file in a brower.
