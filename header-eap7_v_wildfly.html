<h1>Summary of EAP 7 Resolved Vulnerabilities</h1>
<h2>Red Hat Enterprise Application Platform is the enterprise product, WildFly is the community project</h2>
<p>Red Hat's Enterprise Application Platform (EAP) is our enterprise application server product that is derived from the upstream WildFly application server community project.  There is a significant difference between an upstream open source community project and the downstream enterprise product.  Each release of EAP is derived from a community release of WildFly and then put through extensive quality engineering tests, defense in depth hardening, and a regular cadence of security patches and updates to meet the needs of enterprise users.  EAP 7 was initially derived from WildFly 10+, but has since undergone several security updates and patches.</p>
<h2>Resolved Vulnerabilities in EAP</h2>
<p>This table is a snapshot in time showing the number and type of vulnerabilities resolved in EAP <b>AFTER</b> each community WildFly release.  As you can see, the number and type of vulnerabilities grows over time.  The WildFly community only publishes the latest release, so older releases are never patched.  Users of WildFly must chase the next major release to try to stay current, but this is becoming more difficult because WildFly since version 12 creates a major release every three months.  Each successive major release can include new, changed, deleted, or deprecated features, introducing more uncertainty for each upgrade.</p>
